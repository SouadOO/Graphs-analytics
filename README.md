## INTRODUCTION

The aim of this project is to analyse a realistic large network, by building the graph and computing the main advanced metrics in the first
part,then investigate the robustness of this networks by simulating random failures and target attacks in the second part.
Finally we simulate the social contagion in of this network by implementing the networked coordination game.


#### Technologies

 - Python    : programming language
 - NetwokX   : python library to manipulate graphs
 - Gephi     : visualisation tool of large graph
